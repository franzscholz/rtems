# Vagrant-Image for RTEMS

This will provide a development image for building a vagrant
virtual machine for developing an RTEMS-Application.

The process is based on the RTEMS-Online documentation.

So far:

   * Install the RTEMS Source Builder and build a Sparc toolchain:
   
	cd /vagrant
      	install.sh
